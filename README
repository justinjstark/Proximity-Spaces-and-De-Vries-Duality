Proximity Spaces and de Vries Duality

Abstract: We detail the theory of proximity spaces in the direc-
tion of compactifications and the Smirnov construction, in which a
bijection between compactifications of a Tychonoff space and prox-
imities compatible with this space is given. We then describe the
process of De Vries [3] by forming a category of “de Vries algebras”
and “de Vries morphisms” and showing their dual equivalence to
the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous func-
tions.
